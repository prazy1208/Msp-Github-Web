I am Prazy Jindal. I attended a Workshop hosted by Yashank on Open Source Contribution. It was 2 hours workshop 
but it wasn't boring at all as it but legit amazing. He was really very interactive and his session was really informative. 
Most of all it gave us inspiration to explore Github to meet new opportunities and to earn more and more experience.
To acquire an opportunity to get in with an organization after working hard. It made us aware about the importance of
Open Sources and how they can give us greater benefit and make our task easier. All in all this session was really very 
informative and was worth it.
Thank you so much Yashank for this mind blowing session.
